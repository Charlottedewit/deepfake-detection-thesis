# Deepfake Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the master's thesis:

**"Detecting Deepfake Images Using Deep Learning"**  
*Charlotte de Wit* – Tilburg University, 2025  
*MSc in Data Science & Society*

---

## Thesis Overview

This thesis compares three deep learning models:
- XceptionNet
- EfficientNetB0
- Vision Transformer

These models are evaluated on the Face Deepfake Detection Challenge (FDDC) dataset using:
- Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
- GAN-specific bias analysis
- Saliency maps for interpretability
- Effect size calculation (Cohen’s d)
- Evaluation under distortion (blur, noise, compression, rotation)

## How to Use

You can run the notebook in Google Colab or locally in Jupyter Lab.

### Requirements (Local)

Install packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
